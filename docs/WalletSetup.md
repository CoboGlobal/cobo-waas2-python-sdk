# WalletSetup

The type of wallet setup for the merchant. Each wallet contains multiple cryptocurrency addresses that serve as the merchant’s receiving addresses.  - `Shared`: (Default) Multiple merchants share the same wallet. The wallet’s addresses may be used to receive payments for multiple merchants simultaneously. - `Separate`: Create a dedicated wallet for the merchant to achieve complete fund isolation. All addresses in this wallet are only used to receive payments for this merchant. - `Default`: The default wallet automatically created by the system for the default merchant (the merchant that shares the same name as your organization). **Do not select this option when creating a merchant.**
