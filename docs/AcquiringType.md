# AcquiringType

AcquiringType defines the acquisition logic used in the payment flow: - `Order`: Each order is created with a specific amount and associated payment request. Funds are settled on a per-order basis. - `TopUp`: Recharge-style flow where funds are topped up to a payer balance or account. Useful for flexible or usage-based payment models.
