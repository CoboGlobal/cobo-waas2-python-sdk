# TransactionProcessType

Transaction processing type. Possible values are: - `AutoProcess` (default): After the transaction is constructed, it will be automatically signed and broadcast.   - `BuildOnly`: Set to this value if you want to build the transaction first without automatically signing and broadcasting it. You can manually call the [Sign and broadcast transaction](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/sign-and-broadcast-transaction) operation to complete the signing and broadcasting process.
