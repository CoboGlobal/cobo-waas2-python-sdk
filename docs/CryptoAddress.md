```python
from cobo_waas2.models.crypto_address import CryptoAddress

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of CryptoAddress from a JSON string
crypto_address_instance = CryptoAddress.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(CryptoAddress.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
crypto_address_dict = crypto_address_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of CryptoAddress from a dict
crypto_address_from_dict = CryptoAddress.from_dict(crypto_address_dict)
