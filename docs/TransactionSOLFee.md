# TransactionSOLFee

The transaction fee actually charged by the chain that uses the Solana fee model.  For more details about the Solana fee model, see [Fee models](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/transactions/estimate-fees#fee-models).  Switch between the tabs to display the properties for different transaction fee models. 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**base_fee** | **str** | A fixed fee charged per signature. The default is 5,000 lamports per signature. | [optional] 
**rent_amount** | **str** | The one-time rent required to create and initialize a Solana token Associated Token Account (ATA) — a token sub-address that must be activated before the token can be received or used. This rent is paid by the main (source) address. It is populated only when an ATA must be activated for the transaction; otherwise it is null.  | [optional] 
**compute_unit_price** | **str** | The price paid per compute unit. This value determines the priority fee for the transaction, allowing you to increase inclusion probability in congested conditions. | [optional] 
**compute_unit_limit** | **str** | The maximum number of compute units your transaction is allowed to consume. It sets an upper bound on computational resource usage to prevent overload. | [optional] 
**fee_type** | [**FeeType**](FeeType.md) |  | 
**token_id** | **str** | The token used to pay the transaction fee. | [optional] 
**fee_used** | **str** | The actual on-chain network transaction fee charged for this Solana transaction. For Solana, this value covers the network fee only and does NOT include &#x60;rent_amount&#x60;. The total cost deducted from the transaction&#39;s source (withdrawal) address is &#x60;fee_used&#x60; + &#x60;rent_amount&#x60;, both paid by the same source address.  | [optional] 
**estimated_fee_used** | **str** | The estimated transaction fee. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from cobo_waas2.models.transaction_sol_fee import TransactionSOLFee

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of TransactionSOLFee from a JSON string
transaction_sol_fee_instance = TransactionSOLFee.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(TransactionSOLFee.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
transaction_sol_fee_dict = transaction_sol_fee_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of TransactionSOLFee from a dict
transaction_sol_fee_from_dict = TransactionSOLFee.from_dict(transaction_sol_fee_dict)
```
