# WebhookEventType

The event type. To learn the trigger condition of each event type, refer to [Webhook event types and event data](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/webhook-event-type).   **Currently, you can only trigger test webhook events with the event data types `Transaction` and `TSSRequest`.**
