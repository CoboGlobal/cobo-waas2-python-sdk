# CustodialWeb3TransferSource

The information about the transaction source types `Web3`. Refer to [Transaction sources and destinations](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/transactions/sources-and-destinations) for a detailed introduction about the supported sources and destinations for each transaction type.  - For UTXO-based chains: both `address` and `included_utxos` are optional. If both `address` and `included_utxos` are provided, the UTXOs must belong to the specified address. If neither `address` nor `included_utxos` is provided, the system will select UTXOs from the wallet associated with `wallet_id`. - For account-based chains: You need to provide `address` otherwise the token transfer will fail. However, when estimating fees for a transfer, `address` is not required.  For detailed rules on `address` and `included_utxos` in both regular and RBF transactions, see [Address and included_utxos usage](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/transactions/sources-and-destinations#address-and-included-utxos-usage).  Switch between the tabs to display the properties for different transaction sources.

```python
from cobo_waas2.models.custodial_web3_transfer_source import CustodialWeb3TransferSource

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of CustodialWeb3TransferSource from a JSON string
custodial_web3_transfer_source_instance = CustodialWeb3TransferSource.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(CustodialWeb3TransferSource.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
custodial_web3_transfer_source_dict = custodial_web3_transfer_source_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of CustodialWeb3TransferSource from a dict
custodial_web3_transfer_source_from_dict = CustodialWeb3TransferSource.from_dict(custodial_web3_transfer_source_dict)
